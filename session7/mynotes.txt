CLIENT - SERVER

- The client first starts the communication and makes a request to the server.
- Then the server makes a response for the client.
- There is not just one client, there are many.
- If there is no client, everything is okay but, if the server does not exist, the client does not receive a response.
- These programs are running inside computers (phone, tablet, laptop...).
- The server is located at acomputer where we can find more servers.
- Even if the client and the server are located in the same server, everything  works normally. (Typical model used in this course)
- Inside the internet we have isolated computers connected to each other and divided in groups called networks.
- With the IP address we can identify a single computer that is inside a network.
- The IP address refers to the interface, so one computer can have several ones.
- It does not matter where you connect to the internet and the messages sent to a server will arrive anyways to it.
- My phone's IP address at the university is: 10.0.16.215
- Write down on terminal: ifconfig
- IP of my computer: inet 212.128.253.77
- IP of the teacher's computer: 212.128.253.118
- How can we know if a computer is alive on the internet?
    We have to type on the terminal the command "ping" followed by the IP of the computer we are looking for.
    If we obtain a response, it means that the computer exists.
    Each line is a message sent to the destinatioin computer, it also the appears the time that it takes it to arrive.
    - ping time to 8.8.8.8: 3.49 s
    - ping time to my own machine: 0.048 ms
    - ping time to Dafne's computer: 0.623 ms
    - ping time to my phone: 98.3 ms
    It is not possible to have a smaller time than the one you have for calling your own computer.
- As we are humnas, we use names for calling machines: the URL (Universal Resource Locator), which is identifying of computer interface for humans.
- For obtaining the IP address we can do it through the URL: we write ping on the terminal followed by the URL and we obtain the IP address.
    In this case, it is: 172.217.168.174
    ping to the university: 192.168.46.45
- What is what we need for communicating with a server that is anywhere in the internet? The IP address.
    But, within the same computer there are many applications so we have to use another number, called "port".
    If we want to connect to a server we should indicate the IP address and the port. A standard number for a port is 80.
    If we do not have the port number, we will not be able to connect to the server.
- If I want to communicate with a server, first I should launch a server.This is an example.
